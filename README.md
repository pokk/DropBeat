# System Overview

## Module Dependency Graph

![Module Dependency Graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5198104/85551371-e7c64a80-b65c-11ea-9396-5537c8d22b21.png)

## Architecture of each module

We still would like to use the clean architecture with the dynamic feature so the mixed patteren happened here.

There are so many strict rules in the origin clean architecture, eg. an object on the **presentation layer** can't
access a class on the **data layer**, each layer has their own data classes, the mapper classes, ...etc.

If keeping the rules here, this project will be a hugh project and only one maintainer is me ðŸ˜¢. This project is still
keeping the basic rules but we need to have a compromise with those features.

### Detail of Presentation Layer

- Activity/Fragment:
- ViewModel: It handles the view state and data, and the view logic. Also, it helps a view to connect a usecase. Three
  types of them, **ViewModel**, **AndroidViewModel**, **SavedStateViewModel** will be used.

### Detail of Domain Layer

- OneShot UseCase: Basically, this is one time fetching, just send a request and get a response, eg. normal restful api
  request.
- Observable UseCase: For the local database, once the data we are observing is changed, the obserable usecase will keep
  receiving the changing until the observing finishes.

### Detail of Data Layer

- Repository:
- 3 Layer Cache: We would like to have a cache system. One path is for fetching data from the remote server; another
  path is for the local database.
